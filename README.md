## 🔎 What is execbox?

execbox is a simple and secure app designed to let you run code safely. It works like a sandbox, meaning the code runs in a protected space. This stops any harmful actions from affecting your computer. It is made especially for AI agents and other programs that need to execute code without risk.

You don’t need to be a programmer to use execbox. It keeps safety controls in place so you can use AI and scripts with less worry.

## 🔒 Built-in Safety Features

execbox comes with several safety layers to keep your computer secure:

- **Restricted access:** Code runs inside a virtual space with limited permissions. It can’t access your files or system settings.
- **Timeout limits:** Code that runs too long is stopped to prevent hangs.
- **Resource limits:** CPU and memory use by code are capped.
- **Code inspection:** execbox checks code for dangerous commands before running.
- **Logs:** All execution actions are saved so you can review what happened.

These defenses help execbox protect your machine from bugs, viruses, or harmful scripts.

## 💬 Troubleshooting

- **execbox won’t start:**  
Make sure your OS version is supported and your system meets requirements. Restart your computer and try again.

- **Code runs but shows errors:**  
The error may be in the code itself. Check the code carefully or try a simple example first.

- **Execbox freezes or crashes:**  
Check that your computer has enough free memory. Try closing other programs and rerun execbox.

- **Cannot download execbox:**  
Confirm your internet connection is active. Try using a different browser or check your firewall settings.

## ⚙️ Settings & Customization

In execbox’s menu, you can adjust these options:

- **Timeout duration:** Set how long code can run before stopping.
- **Memory limits:** Change how much RAM code can use.
- **Show logs:** Open the log viewer to check past code runs.
- **Clear sandbox:** Reset the sandbox environment to start fresh.

These options let you fine-tune execbox to your needs and ensure better performance.
